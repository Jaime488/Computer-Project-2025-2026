            <a href="#schneiderca1" class="link"><b>Schneider CA1</b></a>
            <p class="des">The Schneider CA1 was a French World War I tank and one of the first operational tanks used in combat. 
              It had a heavily armored rectangular hull with a front-mounted 75mm short-barreled gun and several 8mm Hotchkiss machine guns. 
              Its top speed was about 8 km/h, making it slow and vulnerable to obstacles like trenches and shell craters. 
              The tank suffered from mechanical unreliability and limited mobility, especially in rough terrain. 
              Despite its flaws, it marked a significant step in armored warfare and influenced future French tank designs.</p>

            <a href="#saintchamond" class="link"><b>Saint-Chamond</b></a>
            <p class="des">The Saint-Chamond was a French World War I tank, developed after the Schneider CA1 as an attempt to improve on its design. 
              It had a long, boxy hull with a front-mounted 75mm gun and several machine guns, but its short tracks made it prone to getting stuck 
              on trenches and rough terrain. Weighing around 23 tons, it was slower and less maneuverable than other tanks of the period, with a top speed of about 8 km/h. 
              Its armor was relatively thin, leaving it vulnerable to artillery and anti-tank weapons. Despite its shortcomings,
               it contributed to early tank development and provided valuable lessons for later French designs.</p>

            <a href="#renaultft" class="link"><b>Renault FT</b></a>
            <p class="des">The Renault FT was a revolutionary French light tank introduced during World War I, often considered the first modern tank
               with a fully rotating turret. It was small, fast, and highly maneuverable, weighing around 6.5 tons and capable of speeds up to 7 km/h. 
               Its armament typically consisted of either a 37mm gun or a machine gun, making it effective for infantry support. The tank&apos;s design—engine in the rear,
                driver in front, and turret on top—set the standard for nearly all future tank designs. Its reliability, ease of production, 
                and tactical flexibility made it one of the most influential tanks of the 20th century.</p>

            <a href="#char2c" class=""><b>Char 2C</b></a>
            <p class="des">The Char 2C was a French super-heavy tank developed after World War I, intended to break through fortified enemy lines.
               It weighed around 69 tons, making it one of the largest tanks of its era, and was armed with a 75mm main gun in a turret and multiple 
               8mm machine guns for secondary defense. Its armor was very thick for the time, reaching up to 45mm, providing strong protection against
                small arms and artillery shrapnel. Despite its impressive size and firepower, it was slow and mechanically complex, with a top speed 
                of only about 7 km/h. Only ten were ever built, and they served mostly in a reserve and training role rather than front-line combat.</p>

              <p class="des">The Char B1 was a French heavy tank developed in the interwar period and used during the early stages of World War II.
                 It featured a 75mm hull-mounted howitzer and a 47mm turret gun, making it heavily armed for its time. 
                 Its thick armor, up to 60mm, provided strong protection against most contemporary anti-tank weapons. 
                 The tank was slow and mechanically complex, with a top speed of about 28 km/h, and required a crew of four to operate efficiently. 
                 Despite its strengths, it struggled against coordinated German attacks in 1940, highlighting the limits of heavy, slow tanks in mobile warfare.</p>

                It was armed with a 47mm main gun in a fully rotating turret and one or two machine guns for secondary defense. Its armor, up to 55mm thick, 
                provided good protection against most contemporary anti-tank weapons. With a top speed of around 40 km/h and good suspension, 
                it was relatively fast and maneuverable for its size. Considered one of the best tanks of the early World War II period, 
                it saw action during the 1940 Battle of France.</p>

            <a href="#amx13" class="link">AMX-13</a>
            <p class="des">The AMX-13 was a French light tank developed in the late 1940s, designed for reconnaissance and rapid deployment.
               It featured a fully oscillating turret with an autoloading 75mm (or later 90mm) gun, giving it a high rate of fire despite its small size. 
               Weighing around 14 tons, it was highly mobile, with a top speed of about 60 km/h and relatively light armor, making it vulnerable to 
               heavier anti-tank weapons. Its compact design allowed for easy transport by rail or ship, which helped its export to many countries.
                The AMX-13 remained in service for decades and underwent numerous upgrades, proving versatile in both combat and training roles.</p>

            <p class="des">The AMX-30 was a French main battle tank introduced in the 1960s, designed with a focus on mobility and firepower rather than heavy armor.
               It was armed with a 105mm main gun and a coaxial machine gun, with some variants later upgraded with improved fire control systems. 
               Its armor was relatively light compared to contemporary tanks, relying on speed and maneuverability for protection. 
               Weighing around 36 tons, it could reach speeds of up to 65 km/h on roads, making it one of the faster MBTs of its time.
                The AMX-30 served extensively in French and allied forces, and many were exported or upgraded into specialized variants over decades of service.</p>

            <p class="des">The Leclerc is a French main battle tank introduced in the 1990s, representing the pinnacle of French armored technology.
               It is armed with a 120mm smoothbore gun, advanced fire control systems, and a coaxial machine gun, giving it high accuracy and lethality.
                Its modular composite armor provides strong protection while keeping the tank relatively light at around 57 tons.
                 The tank is highly mobile, with a top speed of about 72 km/h and advanced suspension for off-road maneuverability. 
                 Equipped with sophisticated electronics and battlefield networking, the Leclerc remains one of the most modern and capable tanks in service today.</p>
