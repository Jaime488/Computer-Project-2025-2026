            <p class="des">The A7V was Germany&apos;s first operational tank during World War I, entering service in 1918. It had a boxy,
               rectangular shape with armor up to 30 mm thick, offering some protection against small arms and shrapnel.
                Its main armament was a 57 mm Maxim-Nordenfelt gun, supplemented by multiple 7.92 mm MG08 machine guns for infantry defense.
                 Powered by a 200 hp engine, it could reach speeds of about 15 km/h on roads, but struggled over rough terrain due to its weight
                  and limited suspension. Only about 20 units were built, making it rare and largely a symbolic entry into Germany&apos;s armored warfare development.</p>

            <p class="des">The A7V-U was a German experimental tank variant developed during World War I as an improvement on the original A7V.
               Unlike the standard A7V, it featured fully tracked, rhomboid-like hulls similar to British tanks, 
               which improved mobility over rough terrain and trenches. It was heavily armored, designed to withstand small arms and light artillery fire,
                and retained multiple machine guns for defense against infantry. The vehicle was significantly larger and heavier than the original A7V,
                 which made it difficult to transport and mechanically unreliable. Only a prototype was built, and it never saw combat before the war ended.</p>

              It was designed to carry a main armament of four 77 mm guns along with multiple machine guns, mounted in a huge,
               armored hull to break through enemy lines. The tank was extremely heavy, around 120 tons, and powered by two 240 hp engines,
                giving it very limited mobility of about 8 km/h. Its design included a rhomboid shape with tracks running the full length of the vehicle,
                 intended to cross trenches and rough terrain. Only two prototypes were partially built, and neither saw combat before the war ended.</p>

                Its armament consisted of a single 37mm cannon and a machine gun, intended for infantry support. 
                The tank had tracked mobility and could reach speeds up to 14 km/h on roads, making it more versatile in rough terrain than heavier tanks.

                 It was lightly armored, with protection mainly against small arms fire, and weighed about 5.4 tons. 
                 Its armament consisted of two machine guns, making it unsuitable for engaging other tanks.
                  The Panzer I was fast and highly maneuverable for its time, reaching speeds of up to 37 km/h on roads.
                   It saw action in the Spanish Civil War and early World War II campaigns, mainly in support roles rather than frontline tank battles.</p>

                Its main armament was a 20 mm autocannon, supported by a machine gun, making it effective against infantry and lightly armored vehicles.
                 The tank was relatively fast, reaching speeds of about 40 km/h, and was highly maneuverable on roads and rough terrain.
                  Panzer II saw extensive use in the early stages of World War II, including the invasions of Poland and France,

               It weighed around 23 tons and had armor up to 70 mm thick in later versions, providing decent protection against early-war anti-tank weapons.
                Its main armament evolved from a 37 mm to a 50 mm cannon, and it carried a coaxial machine gun for additional firepower. 
                The tank could reach speeds of about 40 km/h and was known for its reliability and good mobility on various terrains. 
                Panzer III was widely used during the early and mid-stages of World War II, including campaigns in Poland, France, and North Africa,

               long-barreled 75 mm gun capable of taking on other tanks. Its armor ranged from 30 mm to 80 mm,
                providing solid protection against early- and mid-war anti-tank weapons. Weighing around 25 tons, it could reach speeds of about
                 40 km/h and was highly versatile across different terrains. The Panzer IV saw action on all fronts during the war and remained in production throughout,

                engaging most Allied tanks at medium range. Its open-topped design made it vulnerable to artillery and infantry attacks but allowed for
                 a lighter vehicle and better gun elevation. The Marder I weighed around 10&ndash;12 tons and had reasonable mobility on roads and rough terrain.

              <p class="des">The Maus was a German super-heavy tank developed during World War II, intended to be virtually invulnerable to enemy fire.
                 It weighed around 188 tons, making it the heaviest tank ever built, and had extremely thick armor—up to 240 mm in places.
                  Its main armament consisted of a 128 mm gun, supported by a coaxial 75 mm gun, designed to destroy any Allied vehicle.
                   The tank was very slow, with a top speed of about 20 km/h on roads, and suffered from severe mobility and logistical limitations due to its size.
                    Only two prototypes were completed, and the Maus never saw combat.</p>

              <p class="des">The Jagdtiger was a German heavy tank destroyer introduced in 1944, built on the Tiger II chassis.
                 It weighed around 72 tons and had extremely thick armor, up to 250 mm at the front, making it nearly impervious to most Allied tank guns.
                 Its main armament was a powerful 128 mm gun, capable of destroying any Allied tank at long range. 
                 Despite its firepower and protection, the Jagdtiger was very slow, with a top speed of about 34 km/h, and suffered from mechanical reliability issues.
                  Only around 80 units were produced, and they saw limited action on both the Western and Eastern Fronts.</p>

            <p class="des">The Leopard 1 was a German main battle tank introduced in the 1960s, designed to emphasize mobility and firepower over heavy armor.
               It weighed around 42 tons and had relatively light armor compared to contemporary tanks, relying on speed and maneuverability for protection.
                Its main armament was a 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, effective against most tanks of its era, supported by coaxial and roof-mounted machine guns.
                 The tank could reach speeds of about 65 km/h on roads, giving it excellent operational flexibility. 
                 The Leopard 1 was widely exported and remained in service for several decades, forming the basis for later German tank development.</p>

            <p class="des">The Leopard 2 prototype was a German main battle tank developed in the 1970s as a successor to the Leopard 1.
               It weighed around 55 to 60 tons and featured significantly improved armor protection, including composite armor to withstand contemporary anti-tank weapons.
                Its main armament was a 105 mm or experimental 120 mm gun, capable of engaging modern armored threats at long range. 
                The tank retained high mobility for its weight, reaching speeds of about 65 km/h on roads and demonstrating good cross-country performance. 
                The Leopard 2 prototype served as the foundation for the production Leopard 2 series, which became one of the most successful and
                 widely used main battle tanks in the world.</p>
