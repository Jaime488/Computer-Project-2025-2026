            <p class="des">The Arjun Mk 1 is India's first indigenously developed third-generation main battle tank,
			designed by DRDO and entering service in 2004 after a prolonged development period spanning over three decades. 
			Weighing a hefty 58.5 tons, it features a unique 120mm rifled gun (unlike most modern smoothbore designs) 
			capable of firing APFSDS, HESH, and HEAT rounds, complemented by a computerized fire-control system with thermal
			imaging for night operations. The tank's protection relies on indigenous Kanchan composite armor supplemented
			with explosive reactive armor (ERA) blocks, offering protection against kinetic energy penetrators and shaped 
			charges, though its considerable weight impacts mobility in soft terrain. Powered by a German-origin 1,400-hp MTU 838 Ka-501 diesel engine,
			the Arjun achieves a top speed of 70 km/h on roads, but its heavy weight and large silhouette have drawn criticism compared to more compact designs
			like Russia's T-90. While the Arjun Mk 1 faced challenges including production delays, cost overruns, and mechanical reliability issues,
			it served as the foundation for the improved Mk 1A variant with enhanced electronics, better ERA, and improved suspension, marking an important milestone in India's armored vehicle development.</p>
