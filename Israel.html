            <p class="des">The Merkava Mk 2 is an upgraded version of Israel’s indigenous Merkava series, introduced in 1983 to address lessons from the 1982 Lebanon War,
			with improvements in armor, firepower, and crew survivability. Retaining the Mk 1’s distinctive rear-mounted engine for enhanced crew protection, 
			it added modular composite armor and a redesigned turret with thicker, angled plating to better withstand shaped charges and kinetic rounds.
			Its main armament consists of a 105mm M68 rifled gun (later models upgraded to 120mm), paired with an advanced fire-control system for improved accuracy,
			while secondary weapons include machine guns and a 60mm mortar for anti-infantry use. Powered by a 900-hp Continental diesel engine,
			the Mk 2’s mobility is modest (top speed: 60 km/h), prioritizing defensive strength and battlefield endurance over speed. The Mk 2’s 
			design reflects Israel’s doctrine of crew protection and urban combat adaptability, serving as a bridge between the early Merkava Mk 1 and the more advanced
			Mk 3/4 variants with 120mm guns and heavier armor.</p>

            <p class="des">The Merkava Mk 3, introduced by Israel in 1989, represented a significant evolution in the Merkava series, combining enhanced firepower, 
			superior protection, and cutting-edge technology. At its core was a powerful 120mm smoothbore cannon, developed domestically to replace the older 105mm gun,
			enabling it to engage modern armored threats with greater effectiveness. The tank's defense was revolutionized with modular composite armor, 
			allowing for incremental upgrades, while its redesigned turret and V-shaped hull provided exceptional protection against RPGs, mines, and kinetic penetrators. 
			Under the hood, a 1,200-hp diesel engine delivered improved mobility despite its 65-ton weight, supported by an advanced suspension system for optimal
			performance in Israel's rugged terrain. Rounding out its capabilities were state-of-the-art systems like a digital fire-control suite, thermal imaging,
			and early iterations of active protection, cementing the Mk 3 as a formidable and survivable platform that bridged the gap to the future Merkava Mk 4.</p>
