            <p class="des">The Fiat 2000 was Italy's first true heavy tank, developed during World War I.
               It was a massive, lumbering vehicle weighing around 40 tons and designed to cross trenches and resist small-arms fire.
                Its armament included a 65 mm gun in a fixed hull and several machine guns for close defense. 
                The tank had a distinctive boxy, multi-turreted design, with two smaller turrets in addition to the main armament,
                 reflecting early experimentation with tank layouts. Despite its impressive size and armor for the era,
                  it was slow and mechanically unreliable, and only a few were built, seeing little to no combat.</p>

              <a href="#semovente4732" class="link">Semovente 47/32</a>
              <p class="des">The Semovente 47/32 was an Italian self-propelled gun used during World War II, built on the chassis of the M13/40 or M14/41 medium tank. 
                It mounted a 47 mm L/32 gun in a lightly armored, fixed casemate, primarily intended for infantry support and anti-tank roles. 
                The armor was relatively thin, ranging from 10 to 50 mm, which made it vulnerable to heavier Allied tanks. 
                It had a crew of three and decent mobility for its class, but its small gun struggled against newer, better-armored tanks later in the war.
                Despite its limitations, it was widely used by the Italian army and later by German forces after Italy&apos;s armistice.</p>
