              <p class="des">The Type 95 Ha-Go was a light tank used by the Imperial Japanese Army during the 1930s and World War II.
                 It was lightly armored, with armor thickness ranging from 6 to 12 mm, which made it vulnerable to most anti-tank weapons of the time.
                  The tank was armed with a 37 mm main gun and a coaxial 7.7 mm machine gun, suitable mainly for infantry support and engaging soft targets. 
                  It was powered by a diesel engine, giving it a top speed of around 45 km/h, making it one of the faster tanks of its era.
                   Despite its mobility, the Type 95 Ha-Go became increasingly obsolete as Allied armor improved, suffering heavy losses in later battles in the Pacific.</p>

              <p class="des">The Type 1 Ho-Ni I was a Japanese self-propelled gun developed during World War II to provide mobile artillery and tank destroyer support. 
                It was built on a modified Type 97 Chi-Ha chassis and mounted a 75 mm Type 90 gun in an open-topped casemate instead of a turret. 
                The vehicle had relatively thin armor, ranging from 12 to 25 mm, which protected against small arms fire but left it vulnerable to Allied tanks and artillery. 
                With a top speed of around 38 km/h, it was moderately mobile but primarily intended for defensive and support roles. 
                Only a limited number were produced, and it saw action mainly in the Philippines and Okinawa late in the war.</p>

              <p class="des">The Type 1 Ho-Ni II was an improved Japanese self-propelled gun developed during World War II, designed primarily as a tank destroyer.
                 It was based on the Type 97 Chi-Ha chassis and mounted a more powerful 75 mm Type 1 gun in a fully enclosed, fixed casemate,
                  offering better crew protection than the open-topped Ho-Ni I. Its armor ranged from 12 to 50 mm, 
                  which provided modest defense against small arms and light anti-tank weapons but was still vulnerable to heavier Allied tanks. 
                  The vehicle had a top speed of around 38 km/h, making it mobile enough for defensive and support operations.
                   Production was limited, and it saw action late in the war, mainly in the Philippines and on the Japanese home islands.</p>

              <p class="des">The Type 3 Ho-Ni III was a late-war Japanese self-propelled gun and tank destroyer designed to counter increasingly powerful Allied tanks.
                 It was based on a modified Type 97 chassis and mounted a 75 mm Type 3 tank gun in a fully enclosed, casemate-style superstructure,
                  giving much better protection to the crew compared to earlier Ho-Ni models. Armor thickness ranged from 12 to 50 mm, 
                  sufficient against small arms and light anti-tank weapons but still vulnerable to heavier Allied guns. 
                  Its top speed was about 38 km/h, allowing moderate mobility for defensive and ambush operations. 
                  Only a small number were produced, and most saw action defending the Japanese home islands in 1945 rather than in overseas campaigns.</p>

               It was built on the chassis of the Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank and mounted a 150 mm Type 38 howitzer in an open-topped superstructure.
                Its armor was relatively thin, around 12&ndash;25 mm, sufficient only to protect against small arms and shrapnel,
                 leaving it vulnerable to direct hits from tanks and anti-tank guns. The vehicle had a top speed of approximately 38 km/h, 
                 giving it limited mobility on the battlefield. Production was very limited, and it saw combat mainly in the Philippines and Okinawa late in the war.</p>

            <a href="#type74" class="link">Type 74</a>
            <p class="des">The Type 74 is a Japanese main battle tank that entered service in 1975, designed to replace the older Type 61. 
              It is armed with a 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 rifled gun and a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun, with an additional roof-mounted 12.7 mm machine gun 
              for anti-air and infantry use. Its armor uses a combination of steel and composite materials, offering protection against contemporary
               anti-tank weapons of the 1970s. Powered by a 750 hp Mitsubishi diesel engine, it has a top speed of around 53 km/h and a range of approximately 300 km.
                Though reliable and mobile, it was eventually outclassed by modern tanks, and production was limited to around 893 units.</p>

            <p class="des">The Type 90 is a modern Japanese main battle tank that entered service in 1990, designed to succeed the Type 74.
               It is armed with a 120 mm smoothbore gun, capable of firing advanced APFSDS and HEAT rounds, along with a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun
                and a roof-mounted 12.7 mm machine gun. The tank features advanced composite armor with modular add-on panels and a highly computerized
                 fire-control system, giving it high protection and accuracy against contemporary threats. Powered by a 1,500 hp Mitsubishi diesel engine,
                  it can reach speeds of up to 70 km/h and has excellent mobility for Japan&apos;s varied terrain. Production was limited to around 340 units
                   due to high costs and Japan&apos;s defense budget constraints, making it a highly capable but rare vehicle.</p>

            <p class="des">The Type 10 is Japan&apos;s latest main battle tank, entering service in 2012 to replace older models like the Type 74 and supplement the Type 90.
               It is armed with a 120 mm smoothbore gun compatible with modern APFSDS and high-explosive rounds, a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun, and a roof-mounted
                12.7 mm heavy machine gun. Its modular ceramic-composite armor provides high protection while keeping the tank relatively light, enhancing mobility 
                for Japan&apos;s mountainous and urban terrain. Powered by a 1,200 hp diesel engine, the Type 10 can reach speeds up to 70 km/h and features
                 advanced C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) integration for networked battlefield operations.
                  Production is limited, with around 100 units built, but it represents one of the most advanced and agile MBTs in the world.</p>
