            <p class="des">The Tsar Tank, also called the Lebedenko Tank, was an experimental Russian armored vehicle built in 1914&ndash;1915. 
              It featured a highly unusual design with two giant front wheels over 9 meters in diameter and a small rear wheel for balance, resembling a tricycle. 
              The concept was intended to allow the tank to easily roll over obstacles and trenches on the battlefield. 
              However, during testing, the rear wheel sank into soft ground, leaving the vehicle immobile, and the massive wheels made it an easy target.
               Due to these flaws, the Tsar Tank was abandoned and never entered production.</p>

            <p class="des">The Vezdekhod (“goes anywhere”) was a Russian prototype built in 1915, often considered one of the world&apos;s first tank concepts.
               It was designed by Aleksandr Porokhovschikov as a small, light, tracked vehicle powered by a 10-horsepower engine. 
               Unlike the massive Tsar Tank, the Vezdekhod used a single wide track that wrapped around its body, with small wheels on the sides for steering. 
               Its purpose was to cross trenches and rough terrain while carrying either weapons or supplies. 
               Although tested, it suffered from poor performance and stability issues, and the Russian military rejected it in favor of later armored car and tank designs.</p>

              <p class="des">The T-26 was a Soviet light infantry tank developed in the early 1930s, based on the British Vickers 6-Ton design. 
                It became one of the most widely produced tanks of the interwar period, with over 10,000 built. 
                Armed primarily with a 45 mm gun and a machine gun, it was lightly armored but effective against infantry and early armored vehicles.
                 The T-26 saw extensive combat in conflicts such as the Spanish Civil War, the Winter War against Finland, and the early stages of World War II.
                  By 1941, however, it was obsolete against newer German tanks and suffered heavy losses, 
                  leading to its eventual replacement by more advanced Soviet designs like the T-34.</p>

                 It was based on the American Christie tank chassis, which allowed it to run on either tracks or wheels, giving it exceptional speed for its time.
                  Armed with a 37 mm gun and a machine gun, it had relatively light armor, prioritizing mobility over protection. 
                  The BT-2 was used mainly for training and early mechanized units, though some saw limited combat in the early 1930s. 
                  Its design paved the way for later BT models, which eventually influenced the legendary T-34.</p>

                It featured a large central turret armed with a 76.2 mm gun and two smaller machine gun turrets at the front, 
                giving it a distinctive and heavily armed appearance. Designed to break through fortified enemy positions, 
                it was among the first medium tanks in the world. The T-28 saw combat during the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939,
                 the Winter War with Finland, and the early stages of World War II. However, its relatively thin armor and mechanical unreliability led to high losses,

                 It featured a revolutionary combination of sloped armor, mobility, and firepower, making it highly effective against early German tanks.
                  Initially armed with a 76.2 mm gun (later upgraded to an 85 mm), it balanced speed, protection, and ease of production better than most contemporaries. 
                  The T-34 played a decisive role in battles such as the defense of Moscow, Stalingrad, and the Battle of Kursk, 
                  often being credited with turning the tide on the Eastern Front. With over 80,000 built, it became one of the most produced and iconic tanks in history, 
                  influencing postwar tank design worldwide.</p>

              <p class="des">The KV-1 was a Soviet heavy tank introduced in 1939, named after Kliment Voroshilov. 
                It was heavily armored for its time, with up to 90 mm of protection,
                 making it nearly invulnerable to most German anti-tank weapons during the early stages of Operation Barbarossa.
                  Armed with a 76.2 mm gun, it combined strong firepower with thick armor but suffered from being slow, mechanically unreliable,
                   and difficult to maneuver. Despite its drawbacks, it shocked the German Army in 1941, as few of their weapons could stop it head-on.
                    By 1943, however, advances in German tanks and anti-tank guns made the KV-1 obsolete, 
                    and it was gradually replaced by the more effective IS-series heavy tanks.</p>

                 It was distinguished by its massive, boxy turret mounting a 152 mm howitzer, designed for destroying bunkers and fortifications.
                  While its firepower was formidable, the tank was extremely heavy, slow, 
                  and mechanically unreliable, with the oversized turret making it a large and easy target. During the German invasion in 1941,
                   KV-2s initially terrified enemy forces, as their thick armor and powerful gun could overwhelm most German weapons. 
                   However, their poor mobility, fuel consumption, and vulnerability to breakdowns meant they were soon phased out, 
                   with only a limited number ever produced.</p>

                Built on the chassis of the T-34 medium tank, it mounted an 85 mm D-5T gun in a fixed casemate superstructure, 
                giving it the ability to engage and destroy newer German tanks like the Panther and Tiger at longer ranges. 
                It sacrificed a turret for stronger armament and a lower silhouette, making it more effective in ambush and defensive roles.
                 The SU-85 proved valuable in restoring the Red Army&apos;s ability to counter heavily armored German vehicles until the introduction of the T-34/85 tank. 
                 By 1944, it was gradually replaced by the more powerful SU-100, which carried a 100 mm gun.</p>

                Built on the T-34 chassis, it mounted a 122 mm M-30S howitzer in a fixed casemate, designed to provide direct fire support against fortifications,
                 infantry, and light vehicles. Its large high-explosive shells were effective against enemy strongpoints and could even damage German heavy 
                 tanks through concussive force, though it was not primarily intended as a tank destroyer. 
                 The SU-122 was produced in limited numbers and saw combat on the Eastern Front, often operating alongside T-34s to break through defensive positions.
                  By 1944, it was largely replaced by more specialized vehicles like the SU-85 and SU-100, which were better suited for anti-tank roles.</p>

                 Despite its relatively slow reload time, its firepower and protection made it a formidable breakthrough tank.
                  The IS-2 played a major role in the Red Army&apos;s offensives from 1944 onward, including the Battle of Berlin. 
                  Its design influenced postwar Soviet heavy tanks and cemented its reputation as one of the most powerful tanks of World War II.</p>

                 Despite promising features, the SU-100M never entered mass production, as Soviet doctrine was shifting toward turreted tanks
                  like the T-54 and later MBTs. However, it represented an important transitional step between wartime self-propelled guns and postwar armored vehicles.</p>

               It featured improved sloped armor, a powerful 122 mm M-62 gun, and better mobility compared to earlier IS tanks. 
               Unlike the IS-3 with its distinctive pike nose, the T-10 had a longer hull and a more conventional but heavily armored design.
                It served as the backbone of Soviet heavy tank units during the early Cold War, but by the 1960s, 
                the heavy tank concept was being phased out in favor of more versatile main battle tanks like the T-62. 
                The T-10 remained in limited service for decades and is considered the final evolution of the Soviet heavy tank line.</p>

               including nuclear warfare. It had a very unusual elliptical, UFO-like hull shape with thick sloped armor, 
               intended to resist nuclear blast waves and prevent overturning. Armed with a 130 mm M-65 rifled gun and equipped with an autoloader,
                it was one of the most heavily armed and armored tanks of its era. Its unique four-track suspension gave it excellent mobility on 
                soft ground like snow and swamps, though it was extremely complex and difficult to maintain. Only a single prototype was built,
                 as Soviet doctrine shifted toward main battle tanks, making the Object 279 the last of the true heavy tank experiments.</p>

               giving it superior armor penetration compared to contemporary NATO tanks.
                The T-62 featured improved frontal armor and a low profile but suffered from mechanical issues,
                 a cramped interior, and a relatively slow rate of fire. It saw extensive combat in conflicts such as the Yom Kippur War,

                designed primarily for engaging enemy armor at long range. It featured thick frontal armor, a low profile, 
                and additional machine guns for close defense, making it one of the most heavily armed postwar Soviet SPGs.
                 However, its role was increasingly taken over by turreted main battle tanks like the T-54/55 and later the T-62,
                  which offered more flexibility in combat. Only around 77 units were produced,

                This gave it the ability to engage and destroy enemy tanks at ranges up to 3,300 meters with high accuracy, 
                a revolutionary concept at the time. However, it could only fire guided missiles, had limited ammunition capacity,
                 and suffered from reliability issues, which restricted its practicality. Produced in small numbers from 1968 to 1970,

              Despite its advanced design, it was mechanically complex and expensive, so it was not exported widely, unlike the T-55 and T-62. 
              The T-64 formed the backbone of elite Soviet tank units during the Cold War and served as the technological basis for later designs such as the
