            <p class="des">The Holt Gas-Electric Tank was an experimental American tank developed in 1917 during World War I.
             It used a Holt tractor chassis and was powered by a gasoline engine that drove an electric generator,
              which in turn powered electric motors for the tracks,a hybrid drive system. The vehicle was heavily 
              armored for its time, weighing about 50 tons, and armed with a 75 mm gun and several machine guns.
               Despite its firepower, it was slow, mechanically complex, and difficult to maneuver on rough terrain. 
               Because of these drawbacks, the design was abandoned in favor of more practical tanks like the French Renault FT.

              It featured a fully rotating turret, which was revolutionary for tank design at the time,
               and was typically armed with either a 37 mm gun or a machine gun. The tank had a two-man crew:
                a driver and a gunner/commander. Production was slow, so none reached Europe before World War I ended,
                 though around 950 were eventually built. Despite missing combat in WWI, the M1917 gave the U.S. Army 
                 valuable experience in tank design and operation.</p>

              mass-producible alternative to larger tanks. It was very compact, weighing about 3 tons, 
              and had a crew of two: a driver and a gunner. The vehicle was powered by two Ford Model T engines,
               one for each track, which made it simple but underpowered. Armament consisted of a single 7.62 mm M1919 
               machine gun mounted in the front. Although around 15,000 were planned, only about 15 were built before 
               the end of World War I, and the design was abandoned.</p>

                 The tank had a crew of four and was powered by a radial aircraft engine, giving it relatively good speed and mobility for its time.
                  Though never used in combat, it served as an important training vehicle for U.S. tank crews before World War II.
                   Its design directly influenced the more successful M3 Stuart light tank that followed.</p>

                  The tank had a crew of four and was lightly armored, prioritizing speed and mobility over protection.
                   It saw extensive service with American forces and was also supplied to Allied nations like Britain and the Soviet Union through Lend-Lease.
                    While eventually outclassed by heavier tanks, the M3 Stuart remained valuable for reconnaissance and support roles throughout the war.</p>

                 It had an open-topped design, giving the crew good visibility and ease of operation but leaving them vulnerable to enemy fire. 
                 The vehicle was manned by a crew of five and carried both armor-piercing and high-explosive ammunition. 
                 It first saw combat in the Philippines and North Africa, where it provided mobile anti-tank support against Axis forces. 
                 However, as enemy armor improved, it became obsolete and was phased out by 1943 in favor of more powerful tank destroyers like the M10.</p>

                 It was armed with a 75 mm gun (later upgraded to 76 mm or a 105 mm howitzer in some variants) and multiple machine guns. 
                 With a crew of five, the Sherman was known for its mechanical reliability, ease of production, and adaptability to many roles,
                  from standard tanks to flamethrowers and recovery vehicles. Though not as heavily armored or armed as German tanks like the Panther or Tiger,
                   its speed, numbers, and strong logistical support gave the Allies a decisive advantage. 
                   The M4 Sherman became a symbol of American armored forces and remained in service with many nations long after World War II.</p>

                 The vehicle had a five-man crew and retained the Sherman&apos;s mobility and reliability. It first saw combat in North Africa and was widely used in Europe,
                  especially during the Normandy campaign. Although eventually outclassed by heavier German tanks,
                   the M10 remained effective when used in ambush and support roles, and it was also supplied to Allied nations such as Britain and France.</p>

                  Powered by a radial aircraft engine, it could reach speeds up to 55&ndash;60 mph (making it the fastest tracked armored vehicle of World War II). 
                  Its light armor meant it relied on hit-and-run tactics and ambushes rather than head-on combat. 
                  The Hellcat was highly regarded for its agility and remained in U.S. service until the early Cold War, also seeing postwar use by several allied nations.</p>

                 Armed with a powerful 90 mm gun and multiple machine guns, it was capable of taking on German heavy tanks like the Panther and Tiger.
                  It had a five-man crew, strong frontal armor, and mobility comparable to the Sherman, though heavier and slower. 
                  The Pershing first saw combat in early 1945, participating in the crossing of the Rhine and the push into Germany. 
                  While it arrived too late to play a decisive role in WWII, it bridged the gap between the Sherman and the later M46/M47 Patton series.</p>

               It featured a more powerful Continental engine and a new transmission, which solved the mobility and reliability problems of its predecessor.
                Armed with a 90 mm gun and multiple machine guns, it retained strong firepower while offering better speed and maneuverability. 
                The M46 saw combat during the Korean War, where it performed effectively against Soviet-supplied T-34/85s.
                 Although only about 1,100 were built, it marked the beginning of the famous Patton tank series and paved the way for the M47 and M48.</p>

               It mounted an improved 90 mm gun in a new, larger turret with a distinctive hemispherical shape, along with a coaxial and bow machine gun.
                The tank was powered by the same Continental engine as the M46 but carried upgraded fire-control equipment, including a stereoscopic rangefinder.
                 Although it never saw combat with U.S. forces, it was widely exported and served with many NATO and allied nations during the Cold War. 
                 The M47 was soon replaced in U.S. service by the more advanced M48 Patton, but it remained in use abroad for decades.</p>

               It featured a rounded, cast-armor hull and turret, improved protection, and was initially armed with a 90 mm gun (later upgraded to a 105 mm in some versions).
                Powered by a gasoline engine, it had decent mobility but was known for being fuel-hungry, which limited its range. 
                The M48 saw extensive combat in the Vietnam War, where it provided crucial firepower and support for U.S. and South Vietnamese forces.

               It featured a more angular hull with improved armor protection and was armed with a British-designed 105 mm M68 gun, giving it far greater firepower.
                Unlike its predecessor, it used a diesel engine, which offered better fuel efficiency and range.
                 The M60 served extensively during the Cold War with U.S. forces and many NATO allies, though it never fought in Vietnam.
                  Continuously upgraded through variants like the M60A1, A2, and A3, it remained in frontline service until replaced by the M1 Abrams,

               Its most distinctive feature was its armament: six externally mounted 106 mm recoilless rifles, which could be fired individually or in rapid succession.
                The Ontos had a very small, lightly armored hull with a crew of three, making it fast and maneuverable but vulnerable to enemy fire.
                 It saw its main combat use in the Vietnam War, where it proved highly effective against fortifications and infantry rather than tanks.
                  Despite its power, the Ontos was retired in the late 1960s due to its limited role and logistical challenges.</p>

               though at the cost of high fuel consumption. The Abrams first saw combat in the Gulf War of 1991, where it proved highly effective against Iraqi armor.
                Constantly upgraded through variants like the M1A1, M1A2, and M1A2 SEP, it remains the backbone of U.S. armored forces today.</p>

            <p class=" des">The M901 ITV (Improved TOW Vehicle) was an American anti-tank vehicle introduced in the late 1970s. 
              It was based on the M113 armored personnel carrier but fitted with a roof-mounted, retractable twin-tube launcher for the BGM-71 TOW guided missile. 
              The vehicle had a crew of four (commander, gunner, loader, and driver) and carried additional missiles inside for reloading.
               Its purpose was to provide mobile, long-range anti-armor firepower to mechanized infantry and armored units. 
               The M901 served during the Cold War and saw action in conflicts like the Gulf War before being phased out as newer missile carriers 
               and infantry fighting vehicles took over its role.</p>

            <p class="des">The M1A2 Abrams is an advanced variant of the original M1 Abrams main battle tank, introduced in the early 1990s.
               It retains the 120 mm smoothbore gun and powerful gas turbine engine but incorporates upgraded armor, including depleted uranium layers,
                for greatly enhanced protection. The M1A2 features modern digital systems such as a commander&apos;s independent thermal viewer, 
                improved fire-control, and advanced battlefield networking capabilities. With a crew of four, it offers superior situational awareness, 
                target acquisition, and survivability compared to earlier models. Continuously upgraded through versions like the M1A2 SEP (System Enhancement Package),
                 it remains the frontline U.S. main battle tank today.</p>

               entering service in the late 2010s. It retains the 120 mm smoothbore gun but incorporates advanced electronics, upgraded armor, 
               and improved power systems for better battlefield survivability. Major enhancements include a new auxiliary power unit to reduce fuel use,
                improved communications and networking, and the ability to fire advanced programmable ammunition. It also has upgraded protection against
                 improvised explosive devices (IEDs), anti-tank guided missiles, and cyber/electronic warfare threats.
                  The SEP v3 ensures the Abrams remains one of the most capable tanks in the world while preparing it for future battlefield challenges.</p>
